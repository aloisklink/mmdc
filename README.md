# mmdc

This package has only a single dependency, [`@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`][1].

This package is here to avoid typo-squatting attacks by people running
`npx mmdc`, when they don't have [@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli][1] installed.

Please run `npx --package @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -- mmdc` to avoid using
this package.
